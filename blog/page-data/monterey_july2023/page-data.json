Typically, you‚Äôd be lucky to get 15 feet visibility diving in July in Monterey. This time, I was very lucky as we got 30 feet at Metridium mountain and a good 20 feet at Macabee pinaccle.</p>\n<p>I recently got the Olympus 90mm macro lens and although it was pricy (plus I had to get the Nauticam port for it), it didn‚Äôt disappoint.</p>\n<p>The clarity was amazing!</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a shot of a 5 foot lingcod (yes it was huge) with me about a foot away from it. It‚Äôs amazing how the 2x magnification of the lens made it seem like I was a few inches away from it.<br>\n<img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/MontereyJuly2023/i-n89vSm7/0/fffd2cde/L/MontereyJuly2023-19-L.jpg\" alt=\"ling_cod\"></p>\n<p>I was also thrilled to see a school of rockfish and I got a shot of one of them and the clarity of its face stripes was such a delight!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/MontereyJuly2023/i-N2N4KFp/0/eb34dc70/L/MontereyJuly2023-5-L.jpg\" alt=\"rock_fish\"></p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a shot of a common nudibranch called the Horned Dorid. <img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/MontereyJuly2023-1/i-8TzQ8k2/0/d9ee0dec/L/MontereyJuly2023-1-L.jpg\" alt=\"white_nudi\"></p>\n<p>The highlight for me was seeing not one, not two, but three fringeheads!</p>\n<p>More about them in my next blog üòÅ which you can read <a href=\"https://www.glcodeworks.com/blog/sarcastic_fringehead/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cold Water Diving, Brrr...","date":"July 07, 2023","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/arrow_crabs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Birds Do It, Bees Do It ..."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/sarcastic_fringehead/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fringeheads and a Wolf Eel"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"539ad4b2-fdfb-5357-815d-732b9ba3a65e","previousPostId":"2711b3da-204f-5876-9260-42555f065a86","nextPostId":"1ba45aa4-03ff-53ac-8c47-80a164b4026e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
