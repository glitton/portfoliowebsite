One of my favorite dive sites is one called Shale Island which to my understanding was formed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. It is a raised plateau or what I‚Äôd like to imagine as a giant round table approximately 400ft long and 120ft wide. Under the table top, you will find lots of small critters. I usually dive this site in a clockwise direction then turn around once I hit a sunken anchor covered with strawberry anemonies.</p>\n<p>For this time, I ventured to the left or counter-clockwise where we spotted not one, not two, but three fringeheads!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/MontereyFringeheads/i-NzWtS6S/0/2ebe2e53/XL/MontereyJuly2023-36-XL.jpg\" alt=\"fringehead\"></p>\n<p>These species are known as the sarcastic fringehead due to their territorial temperament and the decorative ‚Äúbranches‚Äù above their eyes.</p>\n<p>I also spotted a baby wolf eel hiding inside its hole and I couldn‚Äôt get enough of her.
